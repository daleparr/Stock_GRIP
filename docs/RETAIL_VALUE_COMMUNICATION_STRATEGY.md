# Retail Value Communication Strategy
## Bridging the Gap Between Technical Excellence and Business Impact

### 🎯 **The Core Challenge**

**Question:** *"What value are we offering to non-technical retail staff? How is this being conveyed?"*

**Current State:** Stock_GRIP has powerful technical capabilities (GP-EIMS, MPC-RL-MOBO) but communicates in technical language that doesn't resonate with retail professionals.

**Target State:** Transform technical sophistication into clear, actionable business intelligence that drives profitable decisions.
