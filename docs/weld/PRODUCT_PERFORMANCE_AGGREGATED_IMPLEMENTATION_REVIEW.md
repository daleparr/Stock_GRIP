## **Production Deployment Recommendations**

### **1. Incremental Processing Strategy**
```sql
-- Implement incremental updates for large datasets
WITH incremental_dates AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT date 
  FROM marketing_attribution 
  WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
    AND date NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT date 
      FROM product_performance_aggregated 
      WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
    )
)
-- Process only new/updated dates
SELECT * FROM product_performance_aggregated_query
WHERE date IN (SELECT date FROM incremental_dates)
```

### **2. Error Handling and Recovery**
```sql
-- Add comprehensive error handling
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Validate input data quality
IF (
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM marketing_attribution 
  WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE() - 1
) = 0 THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'No attribution data for yesterday - aborting product performance update';
END IF;

-- Execute main transformation
INSERT INTO product_performance_aggregated
SELECT * FROM product_performance_aggregated_query
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE() - 1;

-- Validate output quality
IF (
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM product_performance_aggregated 
  WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE() - 1 
    AND (shopify_revenue < 0 OR total_attributed_revenue > shopify_revenue * 2)
) > 0 THEN
  ROLLBACK;
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Data quality issues detected - rolling back';
END IF;

COMMIT;
