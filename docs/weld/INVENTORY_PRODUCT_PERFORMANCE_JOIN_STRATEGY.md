# Inventory + Product Performance Join Strategy for Weld

## Overview
This document provides the exact SQL implementation to join the standalone Inventory Management model with your existing Product Performance Aggregated model, creating a unified dataset for accurate Stock GRIP inventory optimization.

## Join Implementation

### Step 1: Enhanced Product Performance Model with Inventory

```sql

```

## Export Configuration

### File Name
`stock_grip_unified_product_inventory.csv`

### Update Schedule
- **Frequency**: Daily at 6 AM
- **Trigger**: After inventory sync from Shopify
- **Retention**: 30 days of historical data

### Key Fields for Stock GRIP
```
product_sku,                    -- Actual SKU (e.g., "1984-2025-137-05")
current_inventory_level,        -- Real stock on hand
available_inventory,            -- Available for sale
reorder_point,                  -- When to reorder
recommended_order_quantity,     -- How much to order
six_week_demand_forecast,       -- Expected 6-week sales
profit_margin_percentage,       -- Actual profit margin
stock_grip_priority,           -- URGENT/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
inventory_data_status          -- Data quality indicator
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Inventory Management Model
- Use the SQL from `inventory_management_model.sql`
- Connect to your Shopify inventory API
- Add your product cost/pricing data

### 2. Modify Product Performance Model
- Add the join logic above
- Include inventory fields in export
- Test with small dataset first

### 3. Update Stock GRIP Dashboard
- Modify to use `current_inventory_level` instead of estimates
- Use `recommended_order_quantity` from Weld calculation
- Add validation for `inventory_data_status`

## Expected Results

### Before (Current Issues):
- **159,595 units recommended** (massive overstock)
- **Estimated inventory** (unreliable)
- **24,501 records** (data duplication)

### After (With Real Inventory):
- **Realistic order quantities** (5-50 units typical)
- **Actual current stock** (no guessing)
- **~270 records** (9 products Ã— 30 days)
- **Accurate 6-week optimization**

This approach will eliminate the overstock risk and provide your stakeholder with reliable, data-driven inventory decisions.
